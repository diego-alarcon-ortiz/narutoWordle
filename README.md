Hello!! I'm Diego, by the time I upload this I'm a junior developer interested in having a deep knowledge about the basis of web developement, such as pure HTML, CSS and JS.

This project was a challenge, I did it when I was studying the second year of Web Applications Developement.

The most difficult part of this projects are the animations, they are all coded with pure CSS and JS, also programming the rules was a bit new for me, but I could get it with ease.

I hope you to have a good experience by having a look to my work, thanks!!
